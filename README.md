See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

The repository is made up of several branches that include the contents and exercises of each section.

The branches follow a naming strategy like the following:

- `{NN}-exercise`: includes the main contents and the instructions of the exercises
- `{NN}-exercise-solution`: includes the solution of the exercises

### Fetching All the Branches

In order to fetch all the remote branches in the repository you can use the following command:

```bash
$ git fetch --all

# List both remote-tracking branches and local branches
$ git branch --all
```

Then, you can create a local branch based on a remote branch with the following command:

```bash
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <remote_branch_name>
```
